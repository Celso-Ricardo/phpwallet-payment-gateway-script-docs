* A Note: the `Method Identifier Field Name` is the label for the method unique identifier for the client.

## __Second step: Link the method to a currency__

Now that we have registered the Withdrawal Method, we need to define in which currency the withdrawals are going to be made for this method, and we do this by linking a currency to a withdrawal method.                         

* Go to Withdrawal Methods menu, select the Link Method To Currency submenu and click the Add New Button
